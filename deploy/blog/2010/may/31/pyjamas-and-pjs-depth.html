<p>So there hasn&#8217;t been too much going on here for about the past month&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>At the beginning of may, I started working on the front-end for the GameCC Editor, and Pyjamas caught my eye &#8212; my experiences with javascript are often fraught with frustration at the inheritance system there, so I though PyJamas would be the perfect fit &#8212; python input, javascript output, everyone&#8217;s&nbsp;happy!</p>
<p>Unfortunately my initial experiences playing around with pyjamas were less than enjoyable. In <em>running one of there examples</em>, the build worked, but the output javascript was broken. To compound the problem, as I traced through the javascript, I discovered <strong>minimal error/sanity checking on the javascript side</strong>; things like passing undefined around as arguments weren&#8217;t even&nbsp;checked.</p>
<p>When I finally tracked down the bug, (which was actually in their compiler) I wasn&#8217;t completely put off; in fact I was all ready to jump in for some core development, fix the problems I&#8217;d seen and generally make the world a better place&nbsp;;).</p>
<p>Jumping into the code wasn&#8217;t as straightforward as I had imagined, and I soon decided that what was needed (or at least what I wanted) was a ground-up rewrite. Perhaps I was premature in this decision, but the damage is done&#8230;and PJs was what I came up with! Over the past month I&#8217;ve been busy bringing PJs from a twinkle in my eye to a full-fledged conversion solution. For a quick look at what It can currently do, take a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/jabapyth/PJs/tree/master/test/py/">the tests&nbsp;directory</a></p>
