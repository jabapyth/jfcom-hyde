I&#39;m doing some prototyping of UX changed for a website, and created a tool to help you create sandboxed, interactive prototypes. Essentially it lets you take a snapshot of a single section of a page and save it as a static HTML file - including everything that may have been dynamically loaded or changed. Then the in-body javascript is removed, and you&#39;re free to edit the resulting file and produce your interactive mockup.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;much of the complexities of modern lifestyle, opting instead for simplicity
and minimalism. This is by no means a new concept; the ascetic monks from
various religions have embraced such practices for millenia. However, with the
rise of the technological age and the birth of the twenty-first century, such
ideals have become increasingly popular. Why is it, though, that the modern
world with all its conveniences and time-savers would drive so many to reject
these very &amp;quot;advancements&amp;quot;? These amenities and convenient technologies are
developed around and often serve to support a culture of consumerism,
materialism, and individualism. While online shopping, social networking, and
email can be incredibly useful and assist in necessary tasks, they can also be
a significant detriment to our productivity and general well-being. Add to
that the many often disturbing negative uses of these new technologies, and
one can readily understand the urge to step back and focus on the essential.&lt;/p&gt;

carrying on lively conversations, complete with peanut gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;families, would you dare touch it? In a number of cases, online gaming has
done just that. This is only a small percentage, of course, and we can&#39;t live
our lives in fear of everything that has associated risks. We all enjoy
electricity, for example, though it has tremendous power to kill. But this
begs the question: what benefits are there from online gaming that warrant
even the slight risk of devastation? Call me an idealist, but I believe in a
world where truth is more exciting than fiction, where reality is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;
than virtual reality. Is it too much to hope that everyone could be exerting
their individual effort towards something constructive and inherently
meaningful for mankind, rather than commanding hoards of virtual orcs to blow
up someone else&#39;s hoards of virtual orcs? And it&#39;s not just the war games;
cultivating a virtual farm or flinging angry birds seems to accomplish equally
little. I don&#39;t mean to imply that online gaming is devoid of inherent value.
I&#39;m sure that players learn some amount of teamwork and problem solving over
the course of a quest. I propose, however, that spending time and effort in
actual reality results in stronger relationships and greater real value
overall. Escaping the problems we face in real life by immersing ourselves in
a virtual life does nothing to solve our problems, and often just intensifies
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are some of us who happen to be good at the kinds of things that
standardized tests are looking for, and who learn to love to learn &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; their
public education. But for every one who survives public schooling with creativity in tact, there
are a dozen others who buy in to the game, who either spend their time trying
to be good at the things that are tested, or sacrifice their creativity and
lose all desire to learn because the school system so often incentivises
conformity and punishes their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;political science, or economics. If you don&#39;t really care about making tons of
money, then sociology, anthropology, and nonprofit management are
possibilities. In general, though, computer science isn&#39;t on the top of the
&amp;quot;change-maker&amp;quot; list, and yet computer technology is changing the world faster
than anything else.  In many developing nations, the urban and rural poor have
cell phones and satellite dishes before they have shoes and running water. In
the information age, technology has the potential to connect societies and
cultures, and to empower the poor in less-developed nations to speak up and be
heard on a global scale. But who will build the software and design the
hardware that will enable this change? Computer scientists and engineers are
changing the world already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sphere, which invariably end in corrupt leaders and oppression of the masses.
So what makes open source and free software different? The core open
source values look a lot like communism on the face of it; people contribute
without monetary compensation, and receive without having to pay. Everyone
gives what they can and receives what they need. The key difference here,
though, is that the open source phenomenon has been entirely voluntary, in no
way enforced by a government or entity.  For some reason, intelligent,
hard-working people from around the world have gravitated to this standard of
openness, resulting in an incredible number of free software projects, many of
which are very professional and have been able to help millions of people. The
ease of contributing afforded by the internet and the inherent low resource
cost make software development a domain where the ideal of community
contribution and benefit can actually be realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toddlers raised on an iPad have no difficulty navigating the various menus and
interfaces now ubiquitous in the digital age, while their grandparents and
great-grandparents are left in the dust. In fact, &amp;quot;my grandmother&amp;quot; has become
the archetypal &amp;quot;most inept computer user I know&amp;quot;, resulting in claims such as
&amp;quot;this is so easy even my grandmother could use it&amp;quot;. Imagine the clash, then,
when a domain dominated by the elderly -- genealogy -- experiences a
technological revolution, as has occurred over the past few decades. The
search for progenitors lends itself naturally to digitization, but it also
requires the main demographic involved to rely heavily on the younger
generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;under a rock somewhere, alone with my code and safe from predatory companies
and their packs of lawyers. If you&#39;ve missed it, the news is rife with
examples of companies armed with rediculously broad patents--covering things
like &amp;quot;downloading a file&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a webpage with a popup&amp;quot;--who pray on small
startups without the funds to cover the court costs.  The internet is littered
with examples of bright minds speaking out against the current software patent
situation, and I haven&#39;t found one yet touting its benefits, or claiming that
it does in fact encourage innovation or accomplish &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the goals for
which it was originally created.  But it&#39;s important to remember that we haven&#39;t
yet had two decades of the &lt;em&gt;internet&lt;/em&gt;, and the software industry isn&#39;t even
half a century old.  It&#39;s more than likely that the situation will become a
lot more sane after another half-century or so; I have faith in humanity that
judges around the country will eventually understand the nature of software,
and this familiarity will remove the opportunity for predatory &amp;quot;patent
trolling&amp;quot; and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dominating every market it entered. Bill Gates, the magnetic visionary, lead
the company with a philosophy that rejected complacency, always striving for
progress and innovation. That was the Microsoft of the 90s. The most recent
decade saw the software giant become complacent, somehow failing to retain the
air of innovation, drive, and novelty. In mobile devices, the Zune and the
Windows phone were relegated to the back seat while Apple and Google drove the
market. Yet, somehow, Microsoft seems to have accomplished the improbable in
the world of technology: a public image reboot. Young people of today see
Microsoft as cooler than it was two years ago, thanks to a strong emphasis on
design and human connectedness in advertising and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;scientific departments, we have no further to look than the &amp;quot;typical computer
nerd&amp;quot;. Since it&#39;s inception, computer programming has been dominated by
young men whose fascination with computers borders on obsession; early
startups in the now silicon valley were manned by college kids who ran on
pizza and slept in their cubicles. Why would women want to be a part of that?
If the culture of computing had &lt;em&gt;begun&lt;/em&gt; with women, it would likely
be much better structured, cleaner, and less dominated by trial-and-error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;movements even when you aren&#39;t using it. Though this might have a few perks
for users, the real winners are in advertising -- marketers would leap at the
chance to take advantage of that kind of information, to make
ultra-personalized ads based on where you go and what you do. But for the
average user, this could usher in the era forecasted by minority report and
1984, where big brother knows where you are at all times, billboards address
you by name, and abuse of privacy is just too easy to pass up. This begs the
question: is such a future inevitable? Can we imagine technological advance
without such deterioration of privacy? Because if we don&#39;t come up with
something soon, it will no longer be an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;world and especially technology, is finally being opened up, at least
cartographically; google maps will soon be updated with detail about the
streets and cities of the hermit nation, thanks entirely to user contributions.
This instance joins many others in the recent past showing the sometimes
disruptive power of internet collaboration. Even in a country where internet
access is highly restricted, truth and information eventually find their way
out onto the larger scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;last&#34;&gt;So I just got myself an LG-G2x android smartphone [running eaglesblood ICS :)] and I&#39;ve been trying a lot of things out. One thing that I really wanted to get right was a music player app. I looked around at the many reviews of the (mostly adware or freemium) popular music apps, thinking to myself &amp;quot;there&#39;s gotta be a really good, free, even open-source music player. somewhere&amp;quot;. well, I stumbled across &amp;quot;vanilla&amp;quot; early on, but was scared away by the somewhat primitive and downright clucky looking graphics [see the screenshots on &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kreed.vanilla&#34;&gt;google play&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.androidopensourceapplications.com/content/vanilla-music-player&#34;&gt;AndroidOpenSourceApplications&lt;/a&gt; ]. But, after more searching and finding nothing promising, I decided to give it a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;need to pore over pages of API docs... This document + the example contrib parsers
provided should be enough (let me know if they aren&#39;t).&lt;/p&gt;

One thing that has bothered me about distutils is its lack of a &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; command -- it seems strange to me that setuptools has it but distutils does not...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;git&lt;/tt&gt; fairly recently, actually (near the end of last year), but already it has become an integral player in my arsenal of powertools.

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I posted that I was taking over &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/vim-debug/&#34;&gt;a project&lt;/a&gt; which provides a debugging environment in VIM, specifically geared toward PHP. Soon after a guy w/ the handle Epeli asked (perhaps not very grammatically), &amp;quot;I can we debug Python like this with Vim?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I&#39;ve just [re]discovered Vim&#39;s tabs. Which are awesome. What isn&#39;t so awesome is the movement between tabs... &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;:tabnew&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;:tabn&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;:tabp&lt;/tt&gt;. Of course, the beauty of vim is customization -- it&#39;s trivial to make your own keybindings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was wondering how much (if any) of a hit performance would take were I to make excessive use of exceptions, not merely for error reporting, but also for reporting failure (in place of, say, returning None to indicate failure).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been meaning to jump into the wonderful world of CSS meta-languages, but I was turned off by their propensity to be &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://sass-lang.com/&#34;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://lesscss.org/&#34;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; (into which I don&#39;t particularly want to jump); then I found &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://sandbox.pocoo.org/clevercss/&#34;&gt;CleverCSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I remember reading a post on planet python about package testing, and that many people use &amp;quot;setup.py test&amp;quot;. The thing is, I can&#39;t seem to find anywhere that documents just what &amp;quot;setup.py test&amp;quot; does -- it&#39;s some setuptools magic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are times when you want a sequence of items sorted, but regular&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;system-message&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;system-message-title&#34;&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 3)&lt;/p&gt;
Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;sort()&lt;/tt&gt; doesn&#39;t cut it; in normal sorting algorithms, it is assumed that if
&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;cmp(a, b) == 0&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;cmp(b, c) == 0&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt class=&#34;docutils literal&#34;&gt;cmp(a, c) == 0&lt;/tt&gt;. I ran into
a problem here when trying to sort classes by inheritance; sort order is not
necessarily commutative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;productivity. It seems extraordinary that the language could have gotten this
far while still &lt;em&gt;by design&lt;/em&gt; causing no end of headaches for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

For various reasons I wasn&#39;t able to use the regular interface for checking for clean urls, and at the time I installed drupal I hadn&#39;t configured apache correctly, so drupal thought (rightly) that clean urls were not supported.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was looking around for a django models to UML converter and took a bit of doing, but I found one nestled in the app &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/django-command-extensions/&#34;&gt;django-extensions&lt;/a&gt;. As it took a while, I thought I&#39;d spare the next guy a search.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I recently ran into a problem, which didn&#39;t immediately make itself clear (this is one of the troubles that django causes me -- too often the error reporting is just &lt;em&gt;not there&lt;/em&gt;, and forces me to do a good deal of debugging to even determine where the error is occurring).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Currently the host I use (bluehost) likes to SIGKILL my processes if they run too long (in an ssh session). This makes perfect sense from their point of view -- it&#39;s a shared hosting situation, so they don&#39;t want processes hogging resources -- but it can get pretty annoying, especially as I usually have several buffers open in split windows.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;m a power-user in the browser, and I usually have a large amount of tabs open; often it is the case that I can only see the favicon (I use chromium, which shrinks the tabs indefinitely). As such, I make use of favicons to distinguish sites, and this works well for me as most sites have jumped on the favicon bus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One thing that (it looks like) is missing in the django tradition is a generally adopted method for making user-friendly application-specific settings. And this feature is extremely key if we want to appeal to a broader audience; your average person &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; want to have to edit a settings.py file in order to change [most] things. Yes, settings that would require a server restart should go there, but there are a vast number of settings which are UI/display related, and should be dynamically modifiable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recently, I decided that my site needed an overhaul. Initially, I only&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;system-message&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;system-message-title&#34;&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class=&#34;docutils&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 3)&lt;/p&gt;
Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;imagined a theme redesign, but as I examined my site, I realized that drupal
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wasn&#39;t doing it for me. Yes, it&#39;s leaps and bounds ahead of what I&#39;d
done before. Yes, it&#39;s amazing, with incredible contributed themes and
modules. But...it was just insufficient / wrong. For one thing, it&#39;s written
in PHP, which &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; grates on my consience; I&#39;ve done php development, and
it is imo just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; inferior as a language, to, well, many other languages.
Python in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

One thing that I have really missed in playing with songbird is Global Hotkeys for changing the song, etc. This functionality is available for &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://wiki.songbirdnest.com/Getting_Started_with_Songbird/03_Basic_Controls#Hotkeys_.26_Keyboard_Shortcuts&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, but Linux (and Mac) users still have to wait if we want official support. There is a workaround, though, thanks to GeekShadow&#39;s addon &lt;a class=&#34;reference external&#34; href=&#34;http://addons.songbirdnest.com/addons/1381&#34;&gt;Command Line Support&lt;/a&gt;. This allows for all kinds of clever hackery, including global Hotkeys.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

for us, that process, which is at best annoying, and at worst long and

&lt;p&gt;aspiring linux guru should get familiar with. The thing it does, just about
better   than anything else, is handle media files. You can mux them, demux
them, encode/decode, resize, compress  .....you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
