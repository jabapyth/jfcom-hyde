<p>Recently I finally got around to adding comments to this blog; <a class="reference external" href="http://disqus.com">disqus</a> made it so easy that I didn't really have an excuse to
keep putting it off ;)</p>
<p>When I first made this blog...a few months ago, I was simultaneously
discovering <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com">django</a> (they say the way to learn
the ropes in django is to create a blogging engine) and wasn't quite satisfied
with the readily available comments solutions.</p>
<p>I heard from several places that django.contrib.comments has a problem with
taking you out of context if the form needs errors corrected, which really
isn't acceptible. Looking around further, I saw a presentation at djangocon 08
(iirc) about pluggable apps, which looked like a solution, but I really didn't
want to go to the trouble; it was easier to just postpone the comments
question, at least for a time.</p>
<p>As I looked around at the blogs of people talking about django, I kept seeing
&quot;powered by disqus&quot; at the bottom, so I went <a class="reference external" href="http://disqus.com">over to investigate</a>, and was very satisfied by their offering. Of course, it
helps that it's free, and that <strong>the only installation was adding 10 lines of
HTML to the bottom of my blog_post template</strong>.</p>
<p>The real clincher for me though was integration; disqus enables people reading
my blog to use OpenID, facebook, twitter, or general disqus authorization.
People who might not have commented had they been required to sign up for my
site alone would have far fewer qualms.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Recently, I decided that my site needed an overhaul. Initially, I only
imagined a theme redesign, but as I examined my site, I realized that drupal
<em>really</em> wasn't doing it for me. Yes, it's leaps and bounds ahead of what I'd
done before. Yes, it's amazing, with incredible contributed themes and
modules. But...it was just insufficient / wrong. For one thing, it's written
in PHP, which <em>really</em> grates on my consience; I've done php development, and
it is imo just <em>so</em> inferior as a language, to, well, many other languages.
Python in particular.</p>
<p>I really love python, and I get the feeling that it loves me back ;) so I
wanted to find a CMS in python -- because I didn't just want a blog; and I
_really_ didn't want a cookie-cutter website; I had a vision for how it
should look and what it should do that went beyond any pure blog (e.g.
wordpress). So I looked around for a &quot;python CMS&quot; and ran into a few that
looked interesting, but none that looked <em>phenomenal</em>. But then I found
Django.</p>
<p>Of course, at first I was skeptical -- it really didn't look like a CMS (well,
it's <em>not</em> a CMS) and I wasn't sure how well/easily I would be able to write
my website using it. Then I read through the <a class="reference external" href="http://djangobook.com&quot;">Django Book</a> and was totally sold -- this is <em>python</em>, this is <em>well
designed</em> this is, frankly, <strong>awesome</strong>. I still had some questions, though.
Coming as I did from a drupal background (and WordPress before that) I was
still stuck in the monolithic mindset -- Isn't it just plain messy to allow
apps to be anywhere on the python path? Shouldn't there be some federated
system for installing and keeping track of modules?</p>
<p>Then I was searching around on a blog and found a reference to a talk at
DjangoCon 2008: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-S0tqpPga4&quot;">Reusable Apps</a>, which cleared up almost all
the questions I had about django, and the reasons behind its
structure/philosophy.</p>
