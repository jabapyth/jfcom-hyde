<div class="document">
<p>Through modern media, we are well aware of the prevalence of hackers and
compromised accounts, both on a personal and corporate level. Yet somehow
it&#8217;s still easy to be lulled into security by <span class="caps">SSL</span>, secure routers, and
passwords that Google told me were &#8220;very&nbsp;strong&#8221;.</p>
<p>The thing about hacking is it&#8217;s not a science; it&#8217;s an exploration. Security
is not like a ball of string to untangle, where there&#8217;s a sure way to solve it
waiting to be found. Security is a suit of armor which can protect you, but
only if coverage is complete. One chink, however, and there&#8217;s the possibility
that some creative hacker will find your weakness and breach your defenses.
Once the initial barrier is down, it depends on your security practices how
easily the intruder can hop from account to account, wreaking havoc with your
private&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Two days ago I got hacked. Walking home from classes, I found that my gmail
account had send emails with a suspicious-looking link to around 50 people
from my contacts list. I looked around for other damages, but found none; and
it looked like the account had only been compromised an hour or so earlier. I
quickly changed my account&#8217;s password, thanking my lucky stars that the hacker
hadn&#8217;t locked me out, and sent apology emails to everyone&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p>How did this happen? It turns out, the biggest liability in computer security
is summed up by the error code <span class="caps">PEBKAC</span>: Problem Exists Between Keyboard And
Chair. Yes, though computers have vulnerabilities, and exploits are constantly
being found for various operating systems and browsers, You are probably the
source of your data&#8217;s vulnerability. In the early days of computing and the
internet, having a password such as &#8220;password&#8221;, &#8220;123456&#8221;, or one&#8217;s own name
was embarrassingly common. Nowadays most serious websites require some amount
of password length and strength, making accounts far less vulnerable to a
brute force attack. But a major issue that persists is password reuse; it
doesn&#8217;t matter how secure your bank&#8217;s servers are if you use the same password
on a website that has much lower&nbsp;security.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me, it may take a break-in to startle you into beefing up your
security. My advice: don&#8217;t wait, because your hacker might not be as
benign as mine&nbsp;was.</p>
