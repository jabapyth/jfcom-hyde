<p>It&#8217;s time to  stop ignoring the need for general education reform. It&#8217;s true,
there are some of us who happen to be good at the kinds of things that
standardized tests are looking for, and who learn to love to learn <em>despite</em> their
public education. But for every one who survives public schooling with creativity in tact, there
are a dozen others who buy in to the game, who either spend their time trying
to be good at the things that are tested, or sacrifice their creativity and
lose all desire to learn because the school system so often incentivises
conformity and punishes their&nbsp;creativity.</p>
<p>The tragedy here is that these people spend the first few decades of their
lives &#8220;preparing for the workforce&#8221;, hoping to gain an education so they will
be successful in providing for themselves, only to find that the attributes
that are critical for occupational success are the very characteristics that
public school had beaten out of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Assuming that the goal is to educate everyone as much as possible, to increase
their intelligence and help them have more opportunities throughout their
lives, the current system of &#8220;education&#8221; has more than a few curiosities. Why,
for example, do high schools around the country spend a large amount of time
&#8220;teaching to&#8221; the <span class="caps">SAT</span>, the <span class="caps">ACT</span>, and various other standardized tests? Closer
inspection reveals that much of &#8220;education&#8221; is geared toward <em>ranking</em>
children in addition to&#8212;and sometimes in the place of&#8212;teaching&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The need for ranking America&#8217;s youth follows naturally from the notion that
there are a limited number of jobs and a large number of potential employees.
Employers naturally would want to select the best and &#8220;most intelligent&#8221; for
the best jobs. This idea was born of the industrial revolution, where there was
indeed a tremendous glut of labor as people migrated to urban centers <em>en
masse</em>. In such a world of job scarcity, students would in fact <em>want</em> to be
ranked so that they can have the best job possible. This scenario, however, is
a&nbsp;delusion.</p>
<!-- This makes sense if you adhere to the early twentieth century view
that intelligence is static, IQ is a perfect representation of that
intelligence, and that we should have involuntary sterilization of
people who are "just too stupid". I hope I'm not being too generous
when I claim that nobody thinks that way anymore. -->
<p>I hope none of us believe in a world where, regardless of how educated we all
are, the lowest ranked will just <em>have to work at McDonalds</em>, because there
<em>just won&#8217;t be enough</em> good, fulfilling jobs for everyone. It&#8217;s buy-in to
this fallacy of scarcity that leads to the type of ranking&#8212;not
schooling&#8212;which we see happening to our children. With school reform that
encourages creativity and innovation, we will see many more entrepreneurs
pushing the limits of human ability which will <em>create</em> more jobs and lead to a more
flourishing economy&nbsp;overall.</p>
