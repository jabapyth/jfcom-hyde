    I want to change the world.

  p.kicker-more.
    I am an idealist; looking around at the world, I see inefficiency and
    unneccesary suffering wherever I turn. Programming has helped me combat
    inefficiency. Faith has helped me relieve suffering.

        Through prayer, study, discussion and application, I have come to know God. My
        knowledge of His plan for me is one of the most important things in my life,
        and has brought me much happiness.
      p.
        From August 2010 to July 2012 I served as a mormon missionary in Frankfurt,
        Germany, and the surrounding cities. My future wife currently serving a
        mission in Chiclayo, Peru.

        My mother likes to say "there are the <em>really important</em> things in the world,
        and then there's politics". I consider myself to be socially conservative and
        fiscally liberal. I am rather appalled by what has happened to the democratic
        process: the polarization of a two-party sytem and the skyrocketing cost of
        political campeigns, among other things.

      p.
        A professor of mine once said "money's a pain; once you have enough, anything
        more is just increased stewardship". I believe in being fiscally responsible
        regardless of how much money I have. I don't want the deciding question to be
        "can I afford this", but rather "is this a responsible use of this money?" I
        don't want to juistify spending lots of money on unneccesary things while
        people around me struggle to make ends meet.
