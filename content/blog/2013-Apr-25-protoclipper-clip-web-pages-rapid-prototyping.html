I'm doing some prototyping of UX changed for a website, and created a tool to help you create sandboxed, interactive prototypes. Essentially it lets you take a snapshot of a single section of a page and save it as a static HTML file - including everything that may have been dynamically loaded or changed. Then the in-body javascript is removed, and you're free to edit the resulting file and produce your interactive mockup.
{% endmark %}


To use, bookmark the following link. Then when you click the bookmark, the page will get grayer out a bit, and you can click+drag to select the region you want. If you want to quit, click ESC. Once you've selected the region you want, press <Enter> or click inside of the box to finalize -- then the page will be clipped appropriately. Then you can "Ctrl-S" to save the clipped web page, and you can then edit all you want.
