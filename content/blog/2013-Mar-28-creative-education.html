It's time to  stop ignoring the need for general education reform. It's true,                                                                                                                                                                                                 
there are some of us who happen to be good at the kinds of things that                                                                                                                                                                                                        
standardized tests are looking for, and who learn to love to learn *despite* their                                                                                                                                                                                                
public education. But for every one who survives public schooling with creativity in tact, there                                                                                                                                                                                                
are a dozen others who buy in to the game, who either spend their time trying                                                                                                                                                                                                 
to be good at the things that are tested, or sacrifice their creativity and

conformity and punishes their creativity.

The tragedy here is that these people spend the first few decades of their

public school had beaten out of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

Assuming that the goal is to educate everyone as much as possible, to increase

lives, the current system of "education" has more than a few curiosities. Why,                                                                                                                                                                                                
for example, do high schools around the country spend a large amount of time                                                                                                                                                                                                  
"teaching to" the SAT, the ACT, and various other standardized tests? Closer                                                                                                                                                                                                  
inspection reveals that much of "education" is geared toward *ranking*                                                                                                                                                                                                        
children in addition to--and sometimes in the place of--teaching them.                                                                                                                                                                                                        

The need for ranking America's youth follows naturally from the notion that                                                                                                                                                                                                   
there are a limited number of jobs and a large number of potential employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Employers naturally would want to select the best and "most intelligent" for                                                                                                                                                                                                  
the best jobs. This idea was born of the industrial revolution, where there was                                                                                                                                                                                               
indeed a tremendous glut of labor as people migrated to urban centers *en

ranked so that they can have the best job possible. This scenario, however, is
