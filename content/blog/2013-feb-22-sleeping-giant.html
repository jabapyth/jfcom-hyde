{% mark excerpt %}
There was a time when Microsoft was the hottest, fastest kid on the block,
dominating every market it entered. Bill Gates, the magnetic visionary, lead
the company with a philosophy that rejected complacency, always striving for
progress and innovation. That was the Microsoft of the 90s.{% endmark %} The
most recent decade saw the software giant become complacent, somehow failing to
retain the air of innovation, drive, and novelty. In mobile devices, the Zune
and the Windows phone were relegated to the back seat while Apple and Google
drove the market. Yet, somehow, Microsoft seems to have accomplished the
improbable in the world of technology: a public image reboot. Young people of
today see Microsoft as cooler than it was two years ago, thanks to a strong
emphasis on design and human connectedness in advertising and marketing.
