{% mark excerpt %}
In the course of `rewriting CleverCSS
<http://github.com/jabapyth/clevercss2>`_, I wanted to write a `backwards
converter
<http://github.com/jabapyth/clevercss2/blob/master/clevercss/backwards.py>`_
from css to ccss. I thought it would make the tool *much* easier to adopt.
{% endmark %}

You know, you've got this big web project, and you realize that what you really
need is a little more power behind your stylesheets, and it would be *great* to
have scoping, and variables... but you've already got 2,000 lines of css that
you really don't want to port over... just throw it at css2ccss and you're
golden!

Anyway, it currently uses `cssutils <http://cthedot.de/cssutils/>`_, but I
thought that CSS would be another great grammar to try codetalker against. And
the result is `python-css <http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/python-css/>`_.
**108 lines, faster than cssutils...** I'm doing some more detailed benchmarks
which I'll put up later.

**update:** here are the `benchmarks <http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/17/python-css-parsing-benchmarks/>`_
