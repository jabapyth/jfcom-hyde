{% mark excerpt %}
The current software patent environment is enough to make me want to hide
under a rock somewhere, alone with my code and safe from predatory companies
and their packs of lawyers. If you've missed it, the news is rife with
examples of companies armed with rediculously broad patents--covering things
like "downloading a file" or "a webpage with a popup"--who pray on small
startups without the funds to cover the court costs.  The internet is littered
with examples of bright minds speaking out against the current software patent
situation, and I haven't found one yet touting its benefits, or claiming that
it does in fact encourage innovation or accomplish *any* of the goals for
which it was originally created.  But it's important to remember that we haven't
yet had two decades of the *internet*, and the software industry isn't even
half a century old.  It's more than likely that the situation will become a
lot more sane after another half-century or so; I have faith in humanity that
judges around the country will eventually understand the nature of software,
and this familiarity will remove the opportunity for predatory "patent
trolling" and the like.
