{% mark excerpt %}
I was curious today, and I wanted to know whether it was faster to use
`.bind()` to preserve this, or to use a variable like `self`. Granted,
these things are of the nature that, if you're using node, performance
isn't probably your first concern. But my situation was such that I
was using the local variable method, and wanted to know if `bind()`
was faster.

Short answer: `bind()` is a ton slower.

The code:

.. code-block:: js

    function Scoper () {
      var self = this
      this.a = function () {
        self.b = 5
      }
    }

    var s = new Scoper()
    for (var i=0; i<100000000; i++) {
      s.a()
    }

vs
 
.. code-block:: js

    function Binder () {
      this.a = function () {
        this.b = 5
      }.bind(this)
    }

    var b = new Binder()
    for (var i=0; i<100000000; i++) {
      b.a()
    }
 
Realize that I had to go up to over 1 million iterations to get even a
noticable difference.

.. code-block:: bash

    jared@Nintendo ~/tmp » time node binder.js 
    node binder.js  23.56s user 0.07s system 100% cpu 23.503 total
    jared@Nintendo ~/tmp » time node scoper.js
    node scoper.js  0.17s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 0.182 total

See that? That's ~140 times faster. Huh.
