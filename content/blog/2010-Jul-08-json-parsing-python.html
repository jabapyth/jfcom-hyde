{% mark excerpt %}
I've done some benchmarks on JSON parsing, and I thought I'd share the results.

(note: simplejson, jsonlib and cjson all finished ~.02 seconds, so you can't really see the bars)

`[here's the code I used, if you want it -- run "runner.py"] <http://jaredforsyth.com/media/uploads/json_tests.tgz>`_

The main reason for testing several different parsing solutions was to compare them to my own json library, which is **only 66 lines long**. And it has comparable performance to other pure-python json libraries. How is this done? `Codetalker <http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/codetalker/>`_

**Codetalker** is a parsing library that I've been developing on and off for the past few months, which aims to facilitate easy and intuitive declaration of grammars, in a pythonic fashion that is influenced by the tradition of BNF, without compromising speed or flexibility.

I'll be writing much more about Codetalker in the near future (if I can find the time), but for now feel free to see for yourself just how easy using codetalker is, with my 66 line `example json parser <http://github.com/jabapyth/codetalker/blob/master/codetalker/contrib/json.py>`_
