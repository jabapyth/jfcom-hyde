The "simplify" trend among productivity specialists calls for a rejection of
much of the complexities of modern lifestyle, opting instead for simplicity
and minimalism. This is by no means a new concept; the ascetic monks from
various religions have embraced such practices for millenia. However, with the
rise of the technological age and the birth of the twenty-first century, such
ideals have become increasingly popular. Why is it, though, that the modern
world with all its conveniences and time-savers would drive so many to reject
these very "advancements"? These amenities and convenient technologies are
developed around and often serve to support a culture of consumerism,
materialism, and individualism. While online shopping, social networking, and
email can be incredibly useful and assist in necessary tasks, they can also be
a significant detriment to our productivity and general well-being. Add to
that the many often disturbing negative uses of these new technologies, and
one can readily understand the urge to step back and focus on the essential.
