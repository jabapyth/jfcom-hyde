{% mark excerpt %}
I discovered ``git`` fairly recently, actually (near the end of last year), but already it has become an integral player in my arsenal of powertools. That said, I have also become intrigued by ``mercurial`` over the past month or so, but not quite enough to switch.

I think I've narrowed down the benefits I can see:

Git:

- staging area (**big one**)
- greater merge flexibility
- great local branching

Mercurial:

- written in python
- good plugin system

Mercurial things that I don't really care about but that others have said:

- nice Windows client
- eclipse integration
- "simpler"

From that list, it looks like Git's benefits are all infrastructure related, where as Mercurial's advantages are derived from implementation specifics.

Do you suppose we could have a port of Git to python, w/ a good plugin system? That would seriously be my "best of both worlds".

Are there any killer arguments against a staging area? Or key structural benefits of mercurial that I overlooked?

Mercurial has a pretty sweet logo though...
