This is the last in a four-part series, in which I demonstrate how to build a
CSS parser using CodeTalker_:

- tokenize_
- parse_
- translate_
- **test!**

.. _parse: http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/28/codetalker-example-parse/
.. _tokenize: http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/27/codetalker-example-tokenize/
.. _translate: http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/29/codetalker-example-translate/
.. _CodeTalker: http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/codetalker/
{% endmark %}

To get the code for this:

``git clone`` `git://github.com/jabapyth/css.git <http://github.com/jabapyth/css/>`_

Test!
=====

No code is complete (and some would say it's broken) without a good amount of
testing, and CodeTalker provides a simple way to test your rules individually,
to ensure the best coverage.

the tests for our CSS grammar are contained in `tests/grammar.py
<http://github.com/jabapyth/css/blob/master/tests/grammar.py>`_. To run them
(ensure you have py.test installed, then) ``py.test tests/grammar.py``. Or
just ``./setup.py test`` to run all of them.

The `codetalker/testing.py
<http://github.com/jabapyth/codetalker/blob/master/codetalker/testing.py#L1>`_
currently only has one function, but it will setup valitation tests for rule
parsing.

Here it is in action:

.. code-block:: python

    import css.grammar as grammar
    from codetalker import testing

    parse_rule = testing.parse_rule(__name__, grammar.grammar)

    parse_rule(grammar.class_, (
        '.one',
        '.green',
        '.GReEn',
        '.div',
        ), (
        'one',
        ))

    parse_rule(grammar.simple_selector, ( # should pass
        'div',
        'div#some',
        'div#one.green',
        'div.frown',
        'ul.cheese:first-child',
        'li.one.two.three',
        'a#b.c.d:last-child',
        ), (                              # should fail
        'one',
        'div# and',
        'div. one',
        ))

When you do that, ``parse_rule`` sets up a verification test for each string.

To get your very own factory function, call ``parse_rule = testing.parse_rule(__name__,
the_grammar)`` (it needs your module's ``__name__`` in order to setup the
functions in your ``global`` namespace, where py.test can recognize and run
them.

Then for each rule you want to test, call ``parse_rule(the_rule,
passing_strings, failing_strings``.

This method of incremental testing is really a boon while you are initially
creating your grammar â€” this way, you don't have to complete the grammar
before you test parts of it out.

Now, in addition to just grammar testing, you should have some testing of your
translation as well, but the nature of those tests depends completely on your
specific project.
