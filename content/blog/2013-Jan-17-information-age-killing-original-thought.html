When my father was growing                     
up, he didn't have wikipedia or google to answer every question. Why is the                     
sky blue? Today you would just look it up on wikipedia. He actually had to                      
*think* if he wanted a reasonable answer. And it's the act and effort of
reasoning about the small things as a child that lead to skills in critical
thinking as an adult. The children of today have instantaneous access to such                   
a glut of information that it provides the illusion that "someone else has
thought about it so I don't have to"; we have become consumers, not producers,                  
of information. As a result we are losing the ability to think critically and                   
to turn that information into knowledge and wisdom.
