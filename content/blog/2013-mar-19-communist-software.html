{% mark excerpt %}
The world has seen several attempts to implement communism in the political
sphere, which invariably end in corrupt leaders and oppression of the masses.
So what makes open source and free software different? The core open
source values look a lot like communism on the face of it; people contribute
without monetary compensation, and receive without having to pay. Everyone
gives what they can and receives what they need. The key difference here,
though, is that the open source phenomenon has been entirely voluntary, in no
way enforced by a government or entity.  For some reason, intelligent,
hard-working people from around the world have gravitated to this standard of
openness, resulting in an incredible number of free software projects, many of
which are very professional and have been able to help millions of people. The
ease of contributing afforded by the internet and the inherent low resource
cost make software development a domain where the ideal of community
contribution and benefit can actually be realized.
