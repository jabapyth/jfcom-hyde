I'm a power-user in the browser, and I usually have a large amount of tabs open; often it is the case that I can only see the favicon (I use chromium, which shrinks the tabs indefinitely). As such, I make use of favicons to distinguish sites, and this works well for me as most sites have jumped on the favicon bus.

In working with django-admin I noticed that it does not define a favicon, and is therefore indistinguishable from other sites. I can see why this would be a low priority, and I didn't want to make up a ticket this close to 1.2, so I just changed it locally, which turned out to be a bit more difficult than it might seem.

Of course django-admin templates can be overridden, and the admin/base.html provides a nice block (extrahead) for inserting things into the head. The problem is that **a template can't extend what the template is overriding**. In the future, I can forsee a system in which one can specify the source of the extension, e.g.

{% raw %}
.. code-block:: html

    {% extends "admin/base.html" from "django.contrib.admin" %}

{% endraw %}
but once again, we have a feature freeze.

I got around this by symlinking the directory, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    ln -s ~/lib/python/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin myproject/templates/admin_tp

and having my "myprojects/templates/admin/base.html" read thus:

{% raw %}
.. code-block:: html

    {% extends "admin_tp/base.html" %}

    {% block extrahead %}
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/media/django-favicon.png"/>
    {% endblock %}

{% endraw %}
And it worked!
