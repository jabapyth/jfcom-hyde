I've been meaning to jump into the wonderful world of CSS meta-languages, but I was turned off by their propensity to be `in <http://sass-lang.com/>`_ `ruby <http://lesscss.org/>`_ (into which I don't particularly want to jump); then I found `CleverCSS <http://sandbox.pocoo.org/clevercss/>`_.

Diving into the code I was a little put off by the `1600+ line(!) monolithic approach <http://github.com/dziegler/clevercss/blob/master/clevercss.py>`_ â€” fortunately, it's hosted on github and open source :) so I `forked it <http://github.com/jabapyth/clevercss>`_, split it into (primarily) seven different files, and generally reorganized it.

Other than that, I didn't really do much, but now that it's in a more digestible format, I expect to do some more hacking away in the future.

here's `my fork <http://github.com/jabapyth/clevercss>`_ of the repo.
