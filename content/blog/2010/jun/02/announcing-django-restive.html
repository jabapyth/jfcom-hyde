`django-restive <http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/django-restive/>`_ is a
short and sweet library for setting up RESTful services in django - both the
django backend and, if you want the javascript frontend.

It was created for the AJAX webapp I'm currently devving -- or rather, spun
off of it. As with many apps, restive was originally built into another project (`GameCC <http://github.com/jabapyth/GameCC>`_) until I realized it deserved an
app of its own.

A few items of interest:

- all communication is in JSON

  - on the client side, POST to the url with the ``data`` keyword holding a JSON
    serialized dictionary of ``key, value`` pairs which will be passed to the
    function as keyword arguments.
  - on the server side, return a dictionary which will be JSON serialized and
    output as text.

- passing Django models is also supported. From the server side, if the
  returned dictionary has\_key ``_models``, they will be serialized using
  Django's built-in JSON serializer.
- I plan to support CSRF token checking.

The aim of *restive* is to get in the way as little as possible =).

**Here's a short sample:** ``my_app/rest.py``

.. code-block:: python

    from restive import Service

    service = Service()

    @service.add
    def hello(request, name='Jimmy'):
        return {'message': 'Hello %s!' % name}

    urlpatterns = service.urls()

and in ``my_project/urls.py`` just do

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ('^myapp/', include('my_app.rest'))
    )

It's as simple as that! Now ``http://example.com/myapp/hello/`` is live and
kicking.

*django-restive II: return of the client-side* coming soon.
