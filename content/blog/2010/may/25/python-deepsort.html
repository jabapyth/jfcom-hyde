There are times when you want a sequence of items sorted, but regular
``sort()`` doesn't cut it; in normal sorting algorithms, it is assumed that if
``cmp(a, b) == 0`` and ``cmp(b, c) == 0``, then ``cmp(a, c) == 0``. I ran into
a problem here when trying to sort classes by inheritance; sort order is not
necessarily commutative.
{% endmark %}


I needed to sort a list of classes (the Standard Exceptions) such that they
were declared in the right order; a class must be declared after all of its
base classes.

Consider the following:

.. code-block:: python

    class A:pass
    class C:pass
    class D:pass
    class B(A):pass

Clearly, A should come before B, but the relative orders of A, C, and D
doesn't really matter. The reason ``sort()`` won't work here is ``cmp(A, C) ==
0`` and ``cmp(C, B) == 0`` but ``cmp(A, B) != 0``. (I tried doing a sort and
was at first confused by the apparently random results I was getting.)

Here's the code I came up with:

.. code-block:: python

    def deepsort(lst, cmp=cmp, max=1000):
        for counter in xrange(max):
            for x in range(len(lst)):
                for y in range(x+1, len(lst)):
                    res = cmp(lst[x], lst[y])
                    if res == 1:
                        lst[x], lst[y] = lst[y], lst[x]
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                break
        else:
            raise Exception('couldn\'t resolve after %d iterations. possible circular comparisons.' % max)

Now, I can't claim that it's all that fast or efficient, but as this was a
one-off operation, I didn't much care.

Essentially, it's a least-fixed-point algorithm, going down the list,
comparing two items, and switching them if one should come before the other. I
put in a max iterations vbl because it's possible for such a sorting to be
cyclic, and therefor never resolvable (not with python classes+bases, but with
other ``cmp`` methods).

For those who are interested, this is the ``cmp`` function I used.

.. code-block:: python

    def classcmp(a, b):
        if issubclass(a,b) and not issubclass(b,a):
            return 1
        if issubclass(b,a) and not issubclass(a,b):
            return -1
        return 0

Have you run into this before? Is there a std lib function I was stupidly
ignoring? `Tell me in the comments
