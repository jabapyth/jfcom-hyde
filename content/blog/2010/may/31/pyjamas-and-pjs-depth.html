So there hasn't been too much going on here for about the past month :)
{% endmark %}


At the beginning of may, I started working on the front-end for the GameCC Editor, and Pyjamas caught my eye -- my experiences with javascript are often fraught with frustration at the inheritance system there, so I though PyJamas would be the perfect fit -- python input, javascript output, everyone's happy!

Unfortunately my initial experiences playing around with pyjamas were less than enjoyable. In *running one of there examples*, the build worked, but the output javascript was broken. To compound the problem, as I traced through the javascript, I discovered **minimal error/sanity checking on the javascript side**; things like passing undefined around as arguments weren't even checked.

When I finally tracked down the bug, (which was actually in their compiler) I wasn't completely put off; in fact I was all ready to jump in for some core development, fix the problems I'd seen and generally make the world a better place ;).

Jumping into the code wasn't as straightforward as I had imagined, and I soon decided that what was needed (or at least what I wanted) was a ground-up rewrite. Perhaps I was premature in this decision, but the damage is done...and PJs was what I came up with! Over the past month I've been busy bringing PJs from a twinkle in my eye to a full-fledged conversion solution. For a quick look at what It can currently do, take a look at `the tests directory <http://github.com/jabapyth/PJs/tree/master/test/py/>`_
