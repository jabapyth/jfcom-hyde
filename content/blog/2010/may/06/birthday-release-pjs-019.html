So today's my birthday, and I thought I'd celebrate by releasing the first
version of PJs_...actually, it's pretty much a coincidence, but i just got PJs
into a state that I'm comfortable letting other people hack away at it, and
it's my birthday. Why 0.19? Because today, in 1991, I was born. So I am now
19. I think the number-play is interesting.

.. _PJs: http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/pjs/

Anyway, if you missed `my announcement
<http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/may/4/announcing-pjs/>`_, PJs is a library
similar in nature to Pyjamas, that is it provides Python to Javascript
translation, with added libraries for easing the development of UIs on the
web. Here are some of the current features:

- true pythonic **object-oriented programming**, visible on the javascript side as
  well
- **function argument checking**: this is important. One of the reasons I
  got frustrated with pyjamas while trying to use it was the lack of robust
  error management. PJs provides optional method argument enforcing, and also
  provides a method of specifying default argument values.
- **\*args and \**kwargs**: this is a really useful one. Javascript doesn't
  normally support argument-magic such as this, but PJs does.
- **modules**: yes, importing works; as nearly to python as is possible; this
  includes things like reload(), sub-modules, and other such wonderful
  goodness. __name__, __file__, and __doc__ variables work too =)

One of the things that I am really proud of with PJs is the care taken to make
the produced javascript *actually readable and usable*. The modules that deal
with pythonic functions and classes *can realistically be used in javascript
hacking*, as they use a reasonable syntax and strive to make sense to humans
=).

- `pjs/js/classy.js
  <http://github.com/jabapyth/PJs/blob/v0.19/pjs/js/classy.js>`_: provides the
  Class function, which handles the creation of classes
- `pjs/js/functions.js
  <http://github.com/jabapyth/PJs/blob/v0.19/pjs/js/functions.js>`_: provides
  the $m function, which can add strict argument checking, default values,
  \*args and \**kargs
- `pjs/js/modules.js
  <http://github.com/jabapyth/PJs/blob/v0.19/pjs/js/modules.js>`_ isn't
  terribly useful without `__builtin__.js
  <http://github.com/jabapyth/PJs/blob/v0.19/pjs/js/__builtin__.js>`_, which
  provides the __import__ function, but the two together can concievably be
  used in any javascript project.

I'm now working on making tests for everything =) There's a file
test/example.py which contains just about everything that PJs currently
handles. To try the translation yourself, just run:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./build.py test/example.py > test/example.js

Then, if you have rhino_ installed, you can run:

.. _rhino: http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/

.. code-block:: bash

   rhino test/example.js

to see the output.

For this release, I have tried to focus on the things which would be most
difficult/interesting, with the exception of two things:

- __add__, __call__ and other python operator magic.
- generators

With the first, I don't know if I'll ever implement it -- there would be too
much of a performance hit to implement this globally (requiring simple things
like ``2 + 3`` to turn into ``Number(2).__add__(Number(3))`` worst case), and
I'm wary of trying any compile-time type/attr checking...

I've had a few ideas today about how to do generators -- it won't be pretty,
but they might come...

Some easy things that remain, and will probably be taken care of in the next
two days:

- while loops
- for loops
- tuples, lists, and dictionaries
- string functions

So I invite you to clone the repo (``git clone git://github.com/jabapyth/PJs.git``)
start playing around with it!

Not bad for one guy in two days, eh?
