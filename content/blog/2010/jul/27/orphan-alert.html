{% mark exerpt %}
In last couple of weeks a few of my projects (most notably `vim-debug`_ and CodeTalker_) have really begun to take off and generate some public interest.
{% endmark %}


.. _vim-debug: http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/vim-debug/
.. _CodeTalker: http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/CodeTalker/

Unfortunately (for the projects), I will be **leaving next week** to serve an `LDS Mission`_ in Germany **for the next two years**, during which time I will have exactly *no time* to pursue various hobbies, including any coding.

**Why should you care?** Well, if anyone has an interest in any of the projects I've got `up on github <http://github.com/jabapyth/>`_, I would be happy to add them as a maintainer, allowing them to push updates to my repo.

Of course, anyone can fork my repos and do whatever they want, but I thought it would be nice to keep things from getting too fractured.

Feel free to contact me at jared@jaredforsyth.com if you're interested.
