I've just [re]discovered Vim's tabs. Which are awesome. What isn't so awesome is the movement between tabs... ``:tabnew`` ``:tabn`` ``:tabp``. Of course, the beauty of vim is customization -- it's trivial to make your own keybindings.

I chose:

  :new: \tn
  :prev: <Control> Left
  :next: <Control> Right

Unfortunately, the normal <C-%> notation doesn't work for "left" and "right" (maybe it's just my keyboard; idk) Anyway, here's what I had to enter (in my .vimrc)::

    map ^[[1;5D :tabp<cr>
    map ^[[1;5C :tabn<cr>
    map <Leader>tn :tabnew<cr>

Yeah; ``^[[1;5D`` = <C-Left>. Don't ask me why.
