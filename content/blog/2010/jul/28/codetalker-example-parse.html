{% mark exerpt %}
This is the second in a four-part series, in which I demonstrate how to build a
CSS parser using CodeTalker_:
{% endmark %}


- tokenize_
- **parse**
- translate_
- `test!`_

.. _tokenize: http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/27/codetalker-example-tokenize/
.. _translate: http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/29/codetalker-example-translate/
.. _test!: http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/29/codetalker-example-test/

To get the code for this:

``git clone`` `git://github.com/jabapyth/css.git <http://github.com/jabapyth/css/>`_

Parsing
=======

In this section we actually define the grammar and the AST attributes.
Fortunately for someone has already gone to the trouble of specifying CSS2 as
a CFG, and the process of transforming their EBNF to CodeTalker is relatively
straight-forward.

*[for the impatient, you can just look at the* `final code`_ *].*

.. _final code: http://github.com/jabapyth/css/blob/master/css/grammar.py

I should mention that **CSS is an interesting case, as far as grammars go**.
With its case-insensitivity, ambiguous tokens (``#FFF`` could either be a
color or a node id depending on the placement), and permissive error handling
(you're supposed to "just ignore anything you don't understand"), it proves
an interesting challange for a world which usually avoids ambiguity and spits
out a "Syntax Error" at the first sign of trouble.

Confession
----------

*But* before we begin the main grammar, I have to address an aspect of CSS that I
conveniently failed to mention during the tokenization stage; CSS identifiers
**can contain a hyphen**, and therefore aren't fully covered by the baked-in
ID token.

It can't even be fixed by using the ``idchars`` option, because then a single
hyphen could be considered an ID, which wouldn't work out.

Now, in my first version of this code, I just used a regexp 

    ``(-\w+)+|\w+(-\w+)*`` 

but for performance reasons, I chose to handle this
special aspect of IDs in a grammar rule. So here it is:

.. code-block:: python

    def cssid(rule):
        ids = ID, COLOR, NODE_NAME, UNIT
        rule | plus('-', _or(*ids)) | (_or(*ids), star('-', _or(*ids)))
        rule.dont_ignore = True
        rule.astAttrs = {'parts': (SYMBOL, ) + ids}

.. yeah*

The ``ids`` variable is a list of all tokens that could concievably match
*part* of a token; e.g. ``green-div-baz`` would be tokenized ``[COLOR, SYMBOL,
NODE_NAME, SYMBOL, ID]``

Also of note is the ``dont_ignore`` flag; normally, whitespace, newlines, and
comments are ignored while parsing grammar rules (for this grammar, anyway),
which is the behavior you'd expect. For this one rule, however, we don't want
to.

Grammar Rules
-------------

Aaaand on to the normal stuff. Here's the ``stylesheet`` rule (which will be
our starting rule):

.. code-block:: python

    def style_sheet(rule):
        rule | ([charset], star(import_), star(section))
        rule.astAttrs = {
                'charset': charset,
                'imports': [import_],
                'sections': [section],
            }

Pretty normal. (if this looks confusing to you, take a look at the `CodeTalker
reference`_)

.. _CodeTalker reference: http://jaredforsyth.com/blog/2010/jul/26/only-codetalker-introduction-youll-ever-need/

But I won't bore you with the details â€” you could just look at `the code`__ for
that.

__ `final code`_

Here are some highlights:

.. code-block:: python

    def charset(rule):
        rule | (no_ignore('@', 'charset'), _or(STRING, SSTRING), ';')
        rule.astAttrs = {
            'charset':{'type':[STRING, SSTRING], 'single':True}
        }

The ``no_ignore`` function indicates that, during the parsing of this
sequence no tokens should be ignored. It's like the ``dont_ignore`` rule flag,
but for a sequence.

Permissive Syntax
-----------------

In order to address the **just ignore any syntax errors, and do your best**
`rule of CSS parsing
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/syndata.html#parsing-errors>`_, I
made an addition to the ``declaration`` rule.

.. code-block:: python

    def declaration(rule):
        rule | (cssid, ':', plus(value), [important], ';')
        rule | (plus(_not(_or(';', '}'))), ';')
        rule.astAttrs = {
            'property':cssid,
            'values':[value],
            'important':important,
        }

Essentially, "first try to make some sense of it, and if that fails, consume
tokens up to the next ';' or '}'". In the second case, the AST attributes will
be None/empty.

Anyway, I think that pretty much sums up what I wanted to focus on. Any
questions? comments? Shakespeare quotations?
