I was looking around for ways to get a look at a python dependency graph, and found `this site <http://www.tarind.com/depgraph.html>`_ which actually does a pretty good job. The only gripe I have regards the command you must use:
{% endmark %}


.. code-block:: bash

   python py2depgraph.py path/to/my/script.py | python depgraph2dot.py | dot -T png -o depgraph.png

Couldn't be easier, right? ...

Anyway, I added a bit of sugar on top of it.

First I put the two files they provided in ~/clone/modgraph

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir ~/clone/modgraph
    cd ~/clone/modgraph
    wget http://www.tarind.com/py2depgraph.py
    wget http://www.tarind.com/depgraph2dot.py
    touch ~/bin/modgraph
    chmod +x ~/bin/modgraph

and then in ~/bin/modgraph

.. code-block:: bash

    if [ -z "$2" ]
    then
        echo "usage: modgraph somepythonfile.py out.png"
        exit
    fi
    python ~/clone/modgraph/py2depgraph.py $1 | python ~/clone/modgraph/depgraph2dot.py | dot -T png -o $2

And of course to use it:

.. code-block:: bash

    modgraph myfile.py outfile.png

Is there another module that does this better? Should I package this up and throw it on pypi?
