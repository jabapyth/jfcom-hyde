Wow, they're not kidding about "Make sure to have leading and trailing slashes"...Don't know what I'm talking about?

That's the 'help text' on the "Create flat page" form -- and boy, do they mean it. I just spent the last [longer than I care to admit] trying to figure out *why* flatpages was giving me a 404! I had installed and configured everything correctly, and, *darn it*, flatpages is about the simplest app out there. *What is wrong with me?*

Well, it turns out I entered "/about" as the url for the page -- extremely foolish of me, I know. What really floored me, though, was that the form didn't complain, and it gave me a link to "view this flatpage on site ->", which invariably led to a 404.

IMO there should definitely be an error thrown if you're stupid enough not to include the trailing slash [submitting ticket now].

**edit:** sent in a patch, so hopefully this we be dealt with
