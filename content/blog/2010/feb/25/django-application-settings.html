One thing that (it looks like) is missing in the django tradition is a generally adopted method for making user-friendly application-specific settings. And this feature is extremely key if we want to appeal to a broader audience; your average person *does not* want to have to edit a settings.py file in order to change [most] things. Yes, settings that would require a server restart should go there, but there are a vast number of settings which are UI/display related, and should be dynamically modifiable.
