I wanted to install the "boost" library on ubuntu, but the problem is that the
library is segmented into several different packages. Now, I could have gone
through and installed each manually, or I could employ a little bash-fu to get
it done for me. Here's the command I used:
{% endmark %}


.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install `apt-cache search 'libboost'|grep '^libboost-'|sed -e's/ .*//'`

    sudo apt-get install `dpkg -l "libboost*1.40-dev"|grep "^un"|sed -e 's/^..  *//' -e 's/ .*//'`

So what does this do? the "sudo apt-get install" should look familiar to an
ubuntu user, but what's the rest, and what in the *world* are those weird `
backtick things?  So first, the backticks tell bash "execute what's inside of
this, and insert the output as though I had typed it in myself". The command
inside of them {dpkg -l "libboost*1.40-dev"|grep "^un"|sed -e 's/^.. *//' -e
's/ .*//'} does the helpful job of listing all currently uninstalled libboost
dev packages.

To break that up (because it's actually three different commands) I'll start
with the first: dpkg -l "libboost*1.40-dev" You can find out more about this
by typing "man dpkg" into a terminal, but basically this command lists all the
packages that match the expression "libboost*1.40-dev" (the -l means *list*).

Here's what the output of that command by itself looks like

.. code-block:: bash

    ummm isn't working right now...
    owell

fine
