Recently I finally got around to adding comments to this blog; `disqus
<http://disqus.com>`_ made it so easy that I didn't really have an excuse to
keep putting it off ;)

When I first made this blog...a few months ago, I was simultaneously
discovering `django <http://djangoproject.com>`_ (they say the way to learn
the ropes in django is to create a blogging engine) and wasn't quite satisfied
with the readily available comments solutions. 
{% endmark %}

I heard from several places that django.contrib.comments has a problem with
taking you out of context if the form needs errors corrected, which really
isn't acceptible. Looking around further, I saw a presentation at djangocon 08
(iirc) about pluggable apps, which looked like a solution, but I really didn't
want to go to the trouble; it was easier to just postpone the comments
question, at least for a time.

As I looked around at the blogs of people talking about django, I kept seeing
"powered by disqus" at the bottom, so I went `over to investigate
<http://disqus.com>`_, and was very satisfied by their offering. Of course, it
helps that it's free, and that **the only installation was adding 10 lines of
HTML to the bottom of my blog_post template**.

The real clincher for me though was integration; disqus enables people reading
my blog to use OpenID, facebook, twitter, or general disqus authorization.
People who might not have commented had they been required to sign up for my
site alone would have far fewer qualms.

Cheers
