Wow. I really hate Internet Explorer. There are so many *bugs*! It's a nightmare to program for, even now!
{% endmark %}


anyway; consider the following.

var b = 3;
var a = function b(){};
alert(b);

any standards-sompliant browser would alert "3"; but no -- IE leaks the function name into the surrounding namespace, and in fact creates *two different functions*. Really, microsoft?
