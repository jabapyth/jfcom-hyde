Recently, I decided that my site needed an overhaul. Initially, I only
imagined a theme redesign, but as I examined my site, I realized that drupal
*really* wasn't doing it for me. Yes, it's leaps and bounds ahead of what I'd
done before. Yes, it's amazing, with incredible contributed themes and
modules. But...it was just insufficient / wrong. For one thing, it's written
in PHP, which *really* grates on my consience; I've done php development, and
it is imo just *so* inferior as a language, to, well, many other languages.
Python in particular.

I really love python, and I get the feeling that it loves me back ;) so I
wanted to find a CMS in python -- because I didn't just want a blog; and I
_really_ didn't want a cookie-cutter website; I had a vision for how it
should look and what it should do that went beyond any pure blog (e.g.
wordpress). So I looked around for a "python CMS" and ran into a few that
looked interesting, but none that looked *phenomenal*. But then I found
Django.

Of course, at first I was skeptical -- it really didn't look like a CMS (well,
it's *not* a CMS) and I wasn't sure how well/easily I would be able to write
my website using it. Then I read through the `Django Book
<http://djangobook.com">`_ and was totally sold -- this is *python*, this is *well
designed* this is, frankly, **awesome**. I still had some questions, though.
Coming as I did from a drupal background (and WordPress before that) I was
still stuck in the monolithic mindset -- Isn't it just plain messy to allow
apps to be anywhere on the python path? Shouldn't there be some federated
system for installing and keeping track of modules?

Then I was searching around on a blog and found a reference to a talk at
DjangoCon 2008: `Reusable Apps
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-S0tqpPga4">`_, which cleared up almost all
the questions I had about django, and the reasons behind its
structure/philosophy.
