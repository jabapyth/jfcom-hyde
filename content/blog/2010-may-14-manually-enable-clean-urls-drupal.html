{% mark excerpt %}
For various reasons I wasn't able to use the regular interface for checking for
clean urls, and at the time I installed drupal I hadn't configured apache
correctly, so drupal thought (rightly) that clean urls were not supported.
{% endmark %}

I just fixed my apache config, and wanted to tell drupal that clean urls were now usable. Here's the SQL command to run:

.. code-block:: sql

    update variable set value='s:1:"1";' where name='clean_url';

that's assuming you ran ``mysql mydbname -u[username] -p`` and are in the mysql shell.

cheers
