{% mark excerpt %}
At first blush, it would seem that those wanting the latest stable python, 2.6, 
would have to compile it themselves (or so `python.org 
<http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.1/>`_ would indicate). Fortunately 
for us, that process, which is at best annoying, and at worst long and 
complicated, is spared us by our friends over at Launchpad, and their 
`"Personal Package Archives" 
<https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA#Installing%20software%20from%20a%20PPA>`_. 
{% endmark %}


In order to install anything from the PPA, you need to add them to your 
repositories: "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/doko/ubuntu/ intrepid main" 

For those who've forgotten how, or just need a refresher, hit `this page 
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Adding%20Repositories%20in%20Ubuntu>`_ 
for full instructions. 

Once you've done that, just run 

.. code-block:: python

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install python2.6

and you're done! (note that aptitude will inform you that this package is *not 
verified* -- because it's not in ubuntu's own repositories).
