{% mark excerpt %}
Take a look at the following boolean expression:
{% endmark %}


.. code-block:: python

    100 < x < 0

never gonna happen, right? math is pretty unequivocal on these things.

but you forget; with `python <http://python.org>`_, anything is possible ;)

.. code-block:: python

    class Faker:
        def __lt__(self, other):
            return True
        def __gt__(self, other):
            return True

    x = Faker()

    if 100 < x < 0:
        print "Universal laws successfully violated!"

Cheers.
