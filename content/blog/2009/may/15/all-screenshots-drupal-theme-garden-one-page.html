{% mark exerpt %}
I got annoyed with `drupal theme garden <http://themegarden.org/>`_ so I whipped up `this page </prog/themegarden.cgi>`_
{% endmark %}


.. image:: /media/images/drupalthemegarden.png

this shows all the screenshots from all the (drupal 6) themes on themegarden.org

`check it out here </prog/themegarden.cgi>`_
