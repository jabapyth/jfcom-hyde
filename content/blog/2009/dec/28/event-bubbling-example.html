Javascript events are handled in a very particular way...
a way that isn't always immediately intuitive. For an excellent description of just how this all works, check out `this article <http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html>`_ over on quirksmode.org. The purpose of this post is to give you a practical knowledge of how this actually works, as well as point out a few quirks.

To start, here's a few nested divs, which each have a 'mouseover' event 
attached -- when the event is fired, it will insert 'leave x' into the 
following textbox. Go ahead and try it -- mouse over one of the divs, and see 
the order (and number) of events fired. 

**OnMouseOver Example**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

a1

a2

a3

a4

 So, what you might notice is that you get a lot more events fired than you 
would expect. Moving your mouse from a2 to a3 results in 'enter a3', 'enter 
a2', 'enter a1'. Even more interestingly, moving from a3 to a2 produces 'enter 
a2', again, along with 'enter a1'. So if you attached something meaningful to 
the a1 onmouseover, you would get many more than you expected. An mouseout is 
just as strange. 

**OnMouseOut Example**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

a1

a2

a3

a4

So going from a2 to a3 means you're *leaving* a2. and a1. But wait, didn't you 
enter them as well? As it turns out, you did both. Thanks to bubbling, things 
get get really complicated, really fast. As a case in point, check out the next 
example: both events combined. Playing around with it should give you a pretty 
good idea of how it all works. 

a1

a2

a3

a4

To highlight one example, going from a2 to a1 means 'leave a2', 'leave a1', and 
then 'enter a1' again.
