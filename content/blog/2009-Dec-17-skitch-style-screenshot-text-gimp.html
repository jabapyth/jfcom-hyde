I've always liked the way that Skitch handles text -- it unobtrusively and stylishly stands out in your screenshot, allowing easy annotations. Unfortunately, Skitch isn't available for linux, so I'm having to do with the next best thing -- Shutter, an open source linux screenshotting solution that's really slick, and mostly gets the job done. The only thing it's lacking is, again, the text -- it will give you text, but the regular kind that too easily gets lost in the background, especially if you're 'shooting something busy like a web page.

To add really slick looking text in The GIMP, first use the text tool to get things rolling. For screenshots, I like to use regular ole' Sans font as size 18, but choose whatever suits you.
