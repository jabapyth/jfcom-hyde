{% mark excerpt %}
I used UNetBootin to install Karmic (Ubuntu 9.10) to my laptop, but I kept running into the error "Failed to unmount partitions"
{% endmark %}

.. code-block:: bash

    The installer needs to commit changes to partition tables, but cannot do so becaue partitions on the following mount points could not be unmounted:

    /cdrom

    Please close any applications using these mount points

    Would you like the installer to try to unmount these partitions again?

This is probably a result of me choosing the "install from Hard Drive" option in UNetbootin, and so I was about to give up, when I tried just unmounting ;)
Of course, ubuntu complained a bit, but when I used strong words (flags) with it, it complied. The command I used was

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo umount -l -r -f /cdrom

which worked like a charm, and allowed installation to continue normally. NOTE: you can't use this method to install ubuntu to the partition from which you ran unetbootin...that just doesn't work.
