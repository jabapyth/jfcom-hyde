Here's a tip for making you're community site that much more user friendly:

change this:

     *http://example.com/user/5275*

to this:

     *http://example.com/users/joe-shmo*

{% endmark %}

Much better, right?

To accomplish this, we will make use of the excellent `Pathauto
<http://drupal.org/project/pathauto>`_ module, which, among other things,
allows us to alias user profile urls.

Once pathauto is installed and enabled, go to *admin/build/path/pathauto*
(*admin/settings/pathauto* in drupal 5), and select **"Bulk generate aliases
for users that are not aliased"** under the "user path settings" dropdown.

This will create the aliases for all your current users (future users will be
aliased as they are registered).

Save the configuration, and you're all set!
