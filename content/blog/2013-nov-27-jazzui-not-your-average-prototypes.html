{% mark excerpt %}
Today I released version 1.0 of a new Web prototyping tool, `JazzUI
<https://github.com/jazzui/jazzui>`_, which, like many of my projects, I built
because I couldn't find the right tool already in existence. I wanted jade,
angular, and lesscss, live updating, automatic fixture data generation,
component(1) support, and easy export of real usable code. So that's what I
made.
{% endmark %}

For me, I have always been frustrated when prototyping tools fall so far short
of the power and flexibility of working with real code. CSS allows you to
theme a whole site with a minimum of changes and javascript allows you to
generated fixture data and have rich interaction. Add on top of that angularjs
and lesscss, and there's a lot you can do with very little code.

And here's a screencast for you, or you can
`play with it yourself <http://jazzui.github.io/jazzui>`_ or
`check out the code in github <https://github.com/jazzui/jazzui>`_.
