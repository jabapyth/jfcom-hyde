{% mark excerpt %}
Currently the host I use (bluehost) likes to SIGKILL my processes if they run too long (in an ssh session). This makes perfect sense from their point of view -- it's a shared hosting situation, so they don't want processes hogging resources -- but it can get pretty annoying, especially as I usually have several buffers open in split windows.

Solution! I now have vim automatically save my session on exit. I put the following line in my .vimrc
::

    autocmd VimLeavePre * mksession! .vim.sess

- `vim docs for autocmd <http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/autocmd.html>`_
- VimLeavePre means "exec just before vim exits"
- the "*" says -- do this for every file type. You could just do "\*.html" or "\*.c"
- `mksession <http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/starting.html#:mksession>`_ saves vim's state

Now whenever you exit, or vim is killed, vim will auto-create a ".vim.sess" file in the current directory. To resume that session, run vim thus::

    vim -S .vim.sess

note the -S is capital
