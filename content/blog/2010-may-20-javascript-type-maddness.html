It truly amazes me the extent to which the javascript interpreter *inhibits*
productivity. It seems extraordinary that the language could have gotten this
far while still *by design* causing no end of headaches for developers.
{% endmark %}


Example 1
----------

When my code has a bug, *please* tell me. Preferably with an error. Even
better, with an informative error and a full stack trace! (ok, maybe that's a
little greedy). But *anything* would be better than passing around
for-goodness'-sake **undefined** variables. I mean seriously? So unhelpful.
Especially when variable types are just converted on the fly with abandon --
you might *not even notice* that there are a number of undefined variables
flying around unless you specifically check for them.

Example 2
----------

Here's some code copied right from the interpreter:

.. code-block:: js

    > var a = {}
    > var b = {3:4}
    > var c = {5:5}
    > a[b] = 4
    4
    > a[c] = 5
    5
    > a[b]
    5

**Woah.** Now maybe some of you look at that and think, *well, duh*, but this
really threw me for a loop the first time I saw it. Coming from a largely
python background, I thought, hmm, objects seem pretty much like dictionaries
[hashtables]; I can deal with that. But the above code seems to contradict
that. *What is going on?* Well, here's something to demonstrate:

.. code-block:: js

    > var a = {}
    > var b = {4:5}
    > a[b] = 12
    > a['[object Object]']
    12

Javascript you sly dog! This is just one of uncountable occasions where
javascript pulls the rug from under you by silently coercing variables to
whatever it wants. Bah.

The main reason I ran into this problem is my `PJs library/tool
<http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/pjs/>`_, which converts python code
into readable, maintainable, and best of all *sane* javascript. This includes
but is not limited to:

**[edit] thanks to Adriano for pointing this out. JS does have OO, but...class-based inheritance makes much more sense to me.**

- *class-based* OO
- module goodness
- function magic \*args, \**kwargs, default values and more
- *strict function argument checking*
- python-style exceptions + **stack traces**
- python basic types (list, tuple, str, dict)
- iterators

I'm still working on 'yield' though. Generators are *hard*.
