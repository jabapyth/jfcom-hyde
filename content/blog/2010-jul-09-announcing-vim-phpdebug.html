{% mark excerpt %}
I've just taken over maintenance of a `really sweet plugin
<http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/vim-phpdebug/>`_ for integrated PHP debugging
in VIM (written in python!). It's `been dead for 3 years
<http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1929>`_, so I figure the air
is clear...
{% endmark %}

anyway, the code is `up on github <http://github.com/jabapyth/vim-phpdebug>`_,
and I've got some features I know I want to add, but even more I'd like to hear
what the community wants. [the plugin is really an interface with `xdebug
<http://www.xdebug.org/>`_, but the most common usage of this that I've seen is
PHP.]

Features:

- integration with xdebug
- step (into/over/out)
- live stack view
- breakpoint set/remove

Planned:

- live interaction console
- conditional breakpoints
- watch expressions
- live scope view

And here's a screenshot: `[full size] <http://jaredforsyth.com/media/uploads/Terminal_019.jpeg>`_
