{% mark excerpt %}
I've had a few people ask me for installations for `vim-debug
<http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/vim-debug/>`_, which I guess is natural...I'm
just not used to the whole "package maintainer" persona yet. Anyway, here it
is.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip install dbgp
    sudo pip install vim-debug
    install-vim-debug.py

.. note::

    To start your debugging session, you need a *capital* D. ``:Dbg``. While
    you are in the session, you can use a lowercase, ex: ``:dbg break``

Those three commands should do it for you.

I tested it on a completely fresh fedora 13 install, and devved on Ubuntu Karmic

I have no idea whether this will work on windows -- if you try it, be sure to tell me!

Thanks
