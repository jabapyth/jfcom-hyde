Ok, so it's technically more than one line -- but all the logic/execution is on one line =)

This is the install script I just whipped up to get django-mingus up and running. It's fairly simple, but the script does a good job of telling you what went wrong (if anything happens to go wrong). What I really hate is copy/pasting ~15 lines of commands into bash, only to have the 3rd one fail for some reason, and the remaining 12 still execute, usually to no effect (lots of errors), but to potentially dangerous effect.

Thus, all the commands are dependant on one another! If one fails, it doesn't blindly execute the rest. I thought of doing an only mess of nested if-else blocks, but instead I took advantage of some bash-fu to join them all together with && (and). Anyway, here's the script. Enjoy. -- it also manages all dependencies of mingus
