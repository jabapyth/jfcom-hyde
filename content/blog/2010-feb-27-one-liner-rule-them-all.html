Ok, so it's technically more than one line -- but all the logic/execution is on one line =)

This is the install script I just whipped up to get django-mingus up and
running. It's fairly simple, but the script does a good job of telling you
what went wrong (if anything happens to go wrong). What I really hate is
copy/pasting ~15 lines of commands into bash, only to have the 3rd one fail
for some reason, and the remaining 12 still execute, usually to no effect
(lots of errors), but to potentially dangerous effect.
{% endmark %}

Thus, all the commands are dependant on one another! If one fails, it doesn't
blindly execute the rest. I thought of doing an only mess of nested if-else
blocks, but instead I took advantage of some bash-fu to join them all together
with && (and). Anyway, here's the script. Enjoy. -- it also manages all
dependencies of mingus.

.. code-block:: bash

    #mingus-install.sh
    projectname=$1
    if [ -z "$projectname" ];then
        echo "No project name given. usage: mingus-install.sh [project_name]"
        exit
    fi
    ( sudo pip install virtualenv && echo "got virtualenv..." ||
        (echo "failed to install virtualenv. Is pip installed properly (try 'sudo easy_install pip' on ubuntu)" && [ -n "" ]) ) && \
    ( sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper && echo "got virtualenvwrapper..." ||
        (echo "failed to install virtualenvwrapper. Is pip installed properly (try 'sudo easy_install pip' on ubuntu)" && [ -n "" ]) ) && \
    ( [ ! -d "$WORKON_HOME/$projectname" ] ||
        (echo "env exists ($WORKON_HOME/$projectname). clear?" && read -e ans && (([ "$ans" == "y" ] && rm -rf "$WORKON_HOME/$projectname") || (echo "exiting $ans" && [ -n "" ])))) && \
    ( source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper_bashrc && mkvirtualenv $projectname --no-site-packages && echo "created virtual environment $projectname ..."  ||
        (echo "" && [ -n "" ]) ) && \
    ( source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper_bashrc && workon $projectname && cd $WORKON_HOME && cd $projectname && echo "woking on $projectname" ||
        (echo "Looks like you failed to create the virtual environment, or \$WORKON_HOME isn't set..." && [ -n "" ]) ) && \
    ( cd $WORKON_HOME && cd $projectname && ./bin/easy_install pip && git clone git://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus.git  ||
        (echo "failed to install pip or django-mingus" && [ -n "" ]) ) && \
    ( cd $WORKON_HOME && cd $projectname && cd django-mingus/mingus ||
        (echo "directory not created correctly" && [ -n "" ]) ) && \
    ( cd $WORKON_HOME && cd $projectname && ./bin/pip install -r django-mingus/mingus/requirements.txt && echo "installed all dependencies..." ||
        (echo "installing all the sub apps...failed" && [ -n "" ]) )  && \
    echo "Looks like everything installed correctly! If anything fails (in the way of package imports), try running 'pip install the_package --upgrade'. cheers!"

    echo "To check it out, \"cd $WORKON_HOME/$projectname\"."
    echo "If everything went well, try \"cd django-mingus/mingus && mv local_settings.py.template local_settings.py && ./manage.py syncdb && ./manage.py runserver\""
    echo "That will start the server up for you w/ default settings"

To run, save this to a .sh file, and run it from the command line.
