If you know indisputably that a behavior or product has destroyed lives and
families, would you dare touch it? In a number of cases, online gaming has
done just that. This is only a small percentage, of course, and we can't live
our lives in fear of everything that has associated risks. We all enjoy
electricity, for example, though it has tremendous power to kill. But this
begs the question: what benefits are there from online gaming that warrant
even the slight risk of devastation? Call me an idealist, but I believe in a
world where truth is more exciting than fiction, where reality is *better*
than virtual reality. Is it too much to hope that everyone could be exerting
their individual effort towards something constructive and inherently
meaningful for mankind, rather than commanding hoards of virtual orcs to blow
up someone else's hoards of virtual orcs? And it's not just the war games;
cultivating a virtual farm or flinging angry birds seems to accomplish equally
little. I don't mean to imply that online gaming is devoid of inherent value.
I'm sure that players learn some amount of teamwork and problem solving over
the course of a quest. I propose, however, that spending time and effort in
actual reality results in stronger relationships and greater real value
overall. Escaping the problems we face in real life by immersing ourselves in
a virtual life does nothing to solve our problems, and often just intensifies
them.
