{% mark excerpt %}
A few days ago, I posted that I was taking over `a project <http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/vim-debug/>`_ which provides a debugging environment in VIM, specifically geared toward PHP. Soon after a guy w/ the handle Epeli asked (perhaps not very grammatically), "I can we debug Python like this with Vim?"
{% endmark %}


but we'll forgive the grammar because he's from Finland, and I can't pronounce `the name of his home town <http://esa-matti.suuronen.org/>`_...

But it was an awesome question! I thought, well why not? The debugger is really just interfacing with a server which conforms to the `DBGp specification <http://www.xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php>`_, and after looking around I was happy to find that `ActiveState had done most of the legwork for me <http://downloads.activestate.com/Komodo/releases/6.0.0b1/remotedebugging/>`_. Unfortunately, there were a few show-stopping bugs in their code, and I couldn't find it anywhere on version control (though it is open source), so I took the liberty of throwing it `up on github <http://github.com/jabapyth/pydbgp>`_ and added my patches -- so now it's ready to use!

*[btw if it is on a VCS somewhere and I missed it, let me know so I can send my fixes upstream]*

That's right; we now have integrated debugging in your favorite power tool (well, mine anyway): VIM.

Here's an `annotated screenshot <http://jaredforsyth.com/media/uploads/images/vim_debug.jpeg>`_ of an active session, showcasing:

- breakpoints
- watch expressions
- execution stack view
- current scope
- output stream copying

On the `github project page <http://jabapyth.github.com/pydbgp/>`_, you can find **install instructions** for the python server. I'll soon put together install instructions for vim-debug.
