{% mark excerpt %}
`FFmpeg <http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/>`_ is a wonderful   tool which every 
aspiring linux guru should get familiar with. The thing it does, just about 
better   than anything else, is handle media files. You can mux them, demux 
them, encode/decode, resize, compress  .....you name it.

Unfortunately, all that versatility means that it can be somewhat confusing, 
if, say *all you want   to do is convert this one file*. 

Well, actually, most of the time, ffmpeg will play nice, and theres this one 
simple command that will   do you: 

.. code-block:: python

    ffmpeg -i "infile.abc" "outfile.cba"

In this manner, you can convert wav to mp3, wmv to avi, or flv to mpg. 

The problems start, of course, when ffmpeg starts spitting out errors. This 
happens when the settings   for your infile are incompatible woth the format of 
your outfile...so the solution is to manually set   those settings. 

if it complains about "timebase not supported by mpeg 4 standard", try adding 
this parameter (before   the outfile param): 

.. code-block:: python

    -r 25

this sets the framerate to the ffmpeg default 

Another error I got was "Sampling rate 11025 is not allowed in mp2" 

to fix that, just set the sampling rate to the default with 

.. code-block:: python

    -ar 44100

Another handy option is the file size limit -- great for compressing a video, 
when you dont want to   mess with bitrates and framerates and the like. The 
file size is specified in bytes, thus 

.. code-block:: python

    ffmpeg -i "large.mov" -fs 10000000 -s qvga "small.avi"

the "-s qvga" parameter resizes the video as well -- down to 320x240.
