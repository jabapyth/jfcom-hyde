In general, age and technological aptitude seem to be negatively correlated.
Toddlers raised on an iPad have no difficulty navigating the various menus and
interfaces now ubiquitous in the digital age, while their grandparents and
great-grandparents are left in the dust. In fact, "my grandmother" has become
the archetypal "most inept computer user I know", resulting in claims such as
"this is so easy even my grandmother could use it". Imagine the clash, then,
when a domain dominated by the elderly -- genealogy -- experiences a
technological revolution, as has occurred over the past few decades. The
search for progenitors lends itself naturally to digitization, but it also
requires the main demographic involved to rely heavily on the younger
generation.
