If you want to change the world, chances are you major in business, law,
political science, or economics. If you don't really care about making tons of 
money, then sociology, anthropology, and nonprofit management are
possibilities. In general, though, computer science isn't on the top of the
"change-maker" list, and yet computer technology is changing the world faster
than anything else.  In many developing nations, the urban and rural poor have
cell phones and satellite dishes before they have shoes and running water. In
the information age, technology has the potential to connect societies and
cultures, and to empower the poor in less-developed nations to speak up and be
heard on a global scale. But who will build the software and design the
hardware that will enable this change? Computer scientists and engineers are
changing the world already.
