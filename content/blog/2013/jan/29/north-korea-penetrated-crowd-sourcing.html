North Korea, which since the end of the Korean war has been shut off from the
world and especially technology, is finally being opened up, at least
cartographically; google maps will soon be updated with detail about the
streets and cities of the hermit nation, thanks entirely to user contributions.
This instance joins many others in the recent past showing the sometimes
disruptive power of internet collaboration. Even in a country where internet
access is highly restricted, truth and information eventually find their way
out onto the larger scene.
