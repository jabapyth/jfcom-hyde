If we want to know why women aren't drawn to CS like they are to other
scientific departments, we have no further to look than the "typical computer
nerd". Since it's inception, computer programming has been dominated by
young men whose fascination with computers borders on obsession; early 
startups in the now silicon valley were manned by college kids who ran on
pizza and slept in their cubicles. Why would women want to be a part of that? 
If the culture of computing had *begun* with women, it would likely 
be much better structured, cleaner, and less dominated by trial-and-error.
