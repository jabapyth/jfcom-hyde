The amazing thing about Mozilla software is, that its hard to be more open than they are. Yes, they're open source, so 'anyone can contribute', but in all seriouseness, most of us are too busy/scared/noob to do anything like that. The real amazing bit lies in the Add-ons, which *anyone* can make, and if you dont like something, you can just role your own fix for it -- in minutes. Using *javasript*. Seriousely, it doesnt get much easier than that.

The newly released version 1.0 of Songbird is no exception: full of 
functionality, and just overflowing with add-ons to do anything you want and 
much more besides. Here's a little tutorial on how I set up my Songbird, on 
Kubuntu Ibex.

First, you need to `grab the .deb <http://www.getdeb.net/release/3519/0>`_ from 
`getdeb.net <http://getdeb.net>`_ (or you can run an `installation script 
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Songbird>`_, provided by the Ubuntu 
community)
