{% mark excerpt %}
This past weekend I experimented with using twitter during one of the sessions
of `General Conference <http://conference.lds.org/>`__. Frankly, it was
similar to watching conference with several dozen other people who were all
carrying on lively conversations, complete with peanut gallery.

I found it detracted greatly from the experience, distracting my attention
while adding very little value. Leaving out all of the "watching #ldsconf in
my PJs", it seemed that most of the activity was just people quoting something
a general authority had just said ... which I would have heard and noted on my
own, as long as I wasn't distracted. For the same reasons that we are asked to
be reverent in a meeting such as sacrament meeting or general conference, 
twitter has no place in meetings where the Holy Spirit is the main teacher.

Where twitter really shines is in the after-conference review and study of the
talks. When you are going over your notes, twitter provides the best quotes,
references, and related material for each talk, saving you a lot of time and
research.
