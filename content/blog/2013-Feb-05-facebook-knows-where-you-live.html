Get ready for Big Brother: Facebook's new app "innovation" will track your
movements even when you aren't using it. Though this might have a few perks
for users, the real winners are in advertising -- marketers would leap at the
chance to take advantage of that kind of information, to make
ultra-personalized ads based on where you go and what you do. But for the
average user, this could usher in the era forecasted by minority report and
1984, where big brother knows where you are at all times, billboards address
you by name, and abuse of privacy is just too easy to pass up. This begs the
question: is such a future inevitable? Can we imagine technological advance
without such deterioration of privacy? Because if we don't come up with
something soon, it will no longer be an option.
