It took a surprising amount of looking to figure out how to create a custom zsh completion rule...so I'll share my findings.

For a static list:

.. code-block:: bash

   compctl -k "(one two other possibility)" command-name

those are space separated, surrounded first by parenthesis and then by quotes.

For some dynamic completion, you specify a function:

.. code-block:: bash

   _my_cpl() {
       reply=(one two other possibility)
   }
   compctl -K _my_cpl command-name

.. note::

   the option is ``-K`` (capital)

Ok, so my example doesn't do anything cool and dynamic =) but that was bare-bones. 

Here's an example of what I'm doing for my `PBJ <http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/pbj/>`_ completion:

.. code-block:: bash

    _make_pbj() {                     
        local a
        read -l a
        reply=(`./make.pbj --list "$a"`)
    }
    compctl -K _make_pbj ./make.pbj

.. note::

   The command name this time is ``./make.pbj`` -- that's totally legal. 

   ``read -l`` returns the text currently being typed in (e.g. ``./make.pbj some_arg``)

Anyway, the zshell function is pretty simple here, too, but it runs a command to get completion options. The "./make.pbj" file outputs a space-separated list of build targets (`PBJ is a build framework <http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/pbj/>`_) which are then interpreted by zsh for you!
