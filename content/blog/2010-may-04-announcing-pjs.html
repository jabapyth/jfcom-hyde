My new project: `PJs <http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/pjs/>`_

I've been keeping an eye on the `pyjamas project <http://pyjs.org>`_ for some
time now (it's been around for a few years at least), but unfortunately It has
never from what I can see lived up to it's potential.

In the mean time, I've been doing a good deal of javascript programming (it's
one of my favorite languages), and been looking for ways to  make that more
friendly -- one issue I have with javascript is the way it tries to handle
Object Oriented design; IMO javascript's solution is a very poor one...
{% endmark %}

So I wrote a library, which I called *classy.js* to **help javascript be a
little more pythonic**. This worked well, and allowed me to organize classes
like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var Foo = Class([Bar], {
        somevar:'val',
        __init__: function(self, a, b){
            alert(a);
        },
        baz: function(self, boo){
            return boo + 3;
        }
    });

This of course corresponds to the following python code:

.. code-block:: python

    class Foo(Bar):
        somevar = 'val'
        def __init__(self, a, b):
            alert(a)
        def baz(self, boo):
            return boo + 3

Not perfect of course, but it follows so much more naturally than the
``prototype`` syntax (note the ``self`` argument -- it's *automagically*
populated!)

But my frustration at pyjamas (it is far too much a port of GWT, but fails at
error handling) has encouraged me to expand upon my pythonic javascript. 

**Thus was PJs born** =) It's like Pyjamas, but shorter, quicker, and more
robust. `PJs <http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/pjs/>`_ is built from the ground
up to produce *readable* javascript from python code.

At the moment I've completed the javascript libraries required to
have pythonic contructs in javascript, including: classes, functions (with
positional, default, and dictionary arguments, as well as strict argument
validation), and modules.

What remains is to make the actual code converter; this should not be too
difficult, as my pjs library as brigded most of the few differences between
python and javascript.
