{% mark excerpt %}
LastFM provides a great REST API, which exposes almost all of its 
functionality, from getting info about a track to finding events in a specific 
area. Today I will demonstrate how to harness a little portion of that power 
with python, namely, getting a user's recent tracks. 
{% endmark %}


The reason I looked into this, was to build a "Last 10 Tracks" Facebook app, 
which is currently in progress. 

If you haven't already done so, head over to last.fm and get an API key, so you 
can access the api.
