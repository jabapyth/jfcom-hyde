{% mark excerpt %}
I was wondering how much (if any) of a hit performance would take were I to
make excessive use of exceptions, not merely for error reporting, but also for
reporting failure (in place of, say, returning None to indicate failure).

The results were pretty conclusive.

And here's the code:

.. code-block:: python

    import time

    def timeit(x, num=1000):
        t = time.time()
        [x() for i in xrange(num)]
        return time.time()-t

    def showtime(xs, num=1000):
        res = [(x, timeit(x, num)) for x in xs]
        for f, one in res:
            print '%s x %d\t' % (f.__name__, num), one
        for f, one in res[1:]:
            print '%s is %03fx faster' % (f.__name__, res[0][1] / one)
        print

    def excepting():
        try:
            res = e2()
        except:
            return None
        return 1

    def e2():
        raise Exception

    def returning():
        res = r2()
        if res is None:
            return None
        return 1

    def r2():
        return None

    showtime((excepting, returning), 1000)
    showtime((excepting, returning), 10000)
    showtime((excepting, returning), 100000)
    showtime((excepting, returning), 1000000)
