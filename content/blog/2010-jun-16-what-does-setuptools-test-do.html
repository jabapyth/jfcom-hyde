{% mark excerpt %}
I remember reading a post on planet python about package testing, and that
many people use "setup.py test". The thing is, I can't seem to find anywhere
that documents just what "setup.py test" does -- it's some setuptools magic.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Thanks
