{% mark excerpt %}
One problem that I needed to solve while making `CodeTalker
<http://jaredforsyth.com/projects/codetalker/>`_ was fast tokenization -- so I
benchmarked several implementations of matching the WHITE and ID tokens.
{% endmark %}

Here's the python implementation, so you understand what's going on:

.. code-block:: python

    def white(at, st, ln):
        i = at
        while i<ln and st[i] == ' ':
            i+=1 
        return i - at

    def id(at, st, ln):
        i = at 
        if i < ln and ('a' <= st[i] <= 'z' or 'A' <= st[i] <= 'Z' or st[i] == '_'):
            i += 1
            while i < ln and  ('a' <= st[i] <= 'z' or 'A' <= st[i] <= 'Z' or st[i] == '_' or '0' <= st[i] <= '9'):
                i += 1
        return i - at

The pypy is of course no different, and for cython I only changed the first two lines of each. e.g.

.. code-block:: cython

   cpdef white(int at, char* st, int ln):
       cdef int i = at

I also checked Regex to see if that would be any faster.

Anyway, the raw results are below, but here's a summary:

**cython wins** by about a factor of 10 each time. pypy is about par w/ regex, which is 10x faster than straight python.

.. note::

    I'm using most recent stable release of pypy: 1.3
