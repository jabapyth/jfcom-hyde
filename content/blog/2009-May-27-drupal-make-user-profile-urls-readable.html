Here's a tip for making you're community site that much more user friendly:
{% endmark %}


change this:

     *http://example.com/user/5275*

to this:

     *http://example.com/users/joe-shmo*

Much better, right?

To accomplish this, we will make use of the excellent `Pathauto <http://drupal.org/project/pathauto>`_ module, which, among other things, allows us to alias user profile urls.

Once pathauto is installed and enabled, go to *admin/build/path/pathauto* (*admin/settings/pathauto* in drupal 5), and select **"

.. image:: file:///tmp/URL%20aliases%20%7C%20YAAlumni%20Test%20Page.jpg

Bulk generate aliases for users that are not aliased"** under the "user path settings" dropdown.

.. image:: /media/images/URL%20aliases%20%7C%20YAAlumni%20Test%20Page-1.jpg

 This will create the aliases for all your current users (future users will be aliased as they are registered).

Save the configuration, and you're all set!
