{% mark excerpt %}
So I just spent the last little while going back to the `dawn of time
<http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/392>`_ and svn revision 392 of django
core-- the current revision is nearly 13 **thousand**) to find the answer to a
surprisingly elusive question: why is there a 
::

    ^templates/(?P<template>.*)/$

pattern in admindocs URLconf, and a corresponding template_detail view?{%
endmark %} (there's no template_list view mind, and no way of ever getting to
the template_detail view other than typing a url in directly).

At first I thought that it might be a recent addition to admindocs, and
therefore not fully implemented -- that could explain its effectively disabled
status. But no, it's a **year dormant** little bit of code.

contrib.admindocs seems to me to be not very well cared for -- especially in
light of its vast importance, imo, to django's user experience. I know that
when I install a module I don't want to dig through all of its code (although
I have resorted to that several times), I want its functionality and
configurability laid out for me in a nice, friendly manner. In keeping with
this, I believe strongly that contrib.admindocs should have the ability to
show me general docs *of my installed modules*, and not just the component
parts. In reality, if I have to look at an app's Models to understand *what it
is the darn thing does*, it's already to late.

As I see it, django suffers from a staggering lack of documentation (mostly
with regards to community apps), which I see as a side-effect of a lack of a
'tradition of documentation'. This is really the biggest barrier to me
installing a new app (as we are *supposed to*, make and use others' reusable
apps).
