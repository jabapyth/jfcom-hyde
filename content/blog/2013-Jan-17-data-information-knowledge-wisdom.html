In pondering the issues raised by the advent of big data and public access to vast stores of information, I am reminded of Rousseau's book *Emilie* in which he describes how best to raise a hypothetical child of the same name. Speaking of the acquisition of knowledge, he writes:

    When I see a man in love with knowledge, ... he seems to me like a child gathering shells on the sea-shore, now picking them up, then throwing them aside for others which he sees beyond them, then taking them again, till overwhelmed by their number and unable to choose between them, he flings them all away and returns empty handed.

It seems all too easy to jet-ski along the surface of the great ocean of knowledge available to us -- flitting through wikipedia articles, browsing blog posts and twitter feeds -- and in the process fail to ever descend below the superficial to where knowledge, understanding, and wisdom are to be found. Speeding through topics and picking up bits of trivia might be enjoyable and give us the illusion of being well-informed, but it short-changes us of the abiding satisfaction and joy that come from comprehension and critical analysis.

The age of consumerism has made us not only consumers of physical products but also of ideas, opinions, and information. Due to the glut of information, we have largely forgotten how to procure our own through independent critical thought.
